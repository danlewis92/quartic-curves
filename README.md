# quartic-curves
Accompanying electronic data for my MSc thesis (supervised by Nils Bruin).

Here we detail a complete list of all curves considered together with the algorithms that should make it relatively easy to check the computations.
TestCurves.m lists all the curves, represented by a sequence of 9 numbers in the interval {âˆ’20,...,20}.
Curves.m provides a minimal model for each of these curves. 
routines.m includes all our algorithms in machine-readable format for MAGMA.

If you run into any problems, or have any other questions, please contact me at dla170@sfu.ca
